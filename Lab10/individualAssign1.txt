Individual Assignment - Siddharth Krishna 

1. The name of the processor selected is 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-13700K.
2. The CPU has three levels of cache: L1, L2, and L3. There is a separate L1 cache for data and instructions.
3. The size of each cache level is the L1 data cache is 12 x 48 KB, L1 instruction cache is 12 x 32 KB, L2 cache is 3 x 2 MB, and the L3 cache is 30 MB.
4. The block size (line size) for all cache levels is 64 bytes.
5. The caches are set associative as the L1 data and instruction caches are 12-way, L2 cache is 8-way, and the L3 cache is known to be 16-way associative.

6. 

number of index bits = approximately 10.
number of offset bits = 6.
number of tag bits assuming 64 bit system = approximately 48.


The work for this is:

Total cache size (L1 data cache) = 576 KB = 12*48 KB
Cache line size (block size) = 64 bytes
Associativity = 12


number of sets = total cache size/cache line size * associativity = 576*1024/64*12 = 768


Index bits = log_2 (# of sets) = log_2 (768) = 9.58 which is rounded to 10 bits

offset bits = log_2 (cache line size) = log_2 (64 bytes) = 6 bits required

***assuming it is 64 bit system*** tag bits = address bits  -  index bits - offset bits = 64 - 10 - 6 = 48 tag bits
