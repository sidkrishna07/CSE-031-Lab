TPS Activity 1: 

1) Static Pool: Storing global and static variables. 

Stack: Storing local variables (declared in functions)  

Heap: Stores dynamic memory allocation (memory declared via malloc())

2) 
a. 3 variables declared
b. 2 of the variables are pointers:
   ptr points to integer
   handle points to an integer pointer
c. num is on the stack because it is an immediately initialized variable
   ptr and handle are on the heap because the space for their data is malloc-allocated
d. it will be the heap

3) DONE 

4) DONE

TPS Activity 2:

1) DONE 

2) DONE

3) The head pointer points to the first node, which consecutively has the other variables right after it.
   The head is directly related to the node, no extra complications.
